Answer: 
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( lowest ( intersection ( place , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( major , intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( most ( river , traverse_2 , state ) )
answer ( len ( intersection ( river , m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , traverse_1 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( count ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( major ( river ) ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( smallest_one ( area_1 , state ) )
answer ( highest ( peak_1 ( country ) , state ) )
answer ( count ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( city_2 ( 'm0' ) ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
Answer: population_1(m0)
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
Answer: largest (intersection (city, loc_2(m0)))
answer ( len ( shortest ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) )
The semantic parse for the utterance "what are the major cities in m0" has already been given in the examples and is as follows:
answer ( count ( intersection ( river , run_through ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( largest ( intersection ( city , loc_1 ( usa ) ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
The semantic parse for the utterance "what is the capital of m0" is: 
answer ( state ( lowest ( intersection ( place , loc_2 ( state ) ) ) ) )
answer ( largest ( capital ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
Answer: 
answer ( intersection ( major , intersection ( city , loc_2 ( smallest ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
answer ( longest ( intersection ( river , traverse_2 ( next_to_2 ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( most ( state , next_to_2 , state ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
